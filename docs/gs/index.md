# Getting Started

In this chapter, we will write some codes to explore the basic features. 

You will learn how to generate a project skeleton quickly from the online service Micronaut Launch or Micronaut CLI.

Then we will create several small projects to demonstrate building RESTful APIs with Micronaut, in the samples, we will use varied combination of different languages and data access technologies.

* [Java + Micronaut Data JPA](./gs-rest.md)
* [Kotlin + Micronaut Data Jdbc](./jdbc-kotlin.md)
* [Kotlin Coroutine + Micronaut Data R2dbc](./r2dbc-kotlin-co.md)
* [Java + Micronaut Mongo Reactive](./mongo-reactive.md)
