# Getting Started

In this chapter, we will write some real codes to explore the basic features. You will learn how to generate a project quickly from the official Micronaut Launch or Micronaut CLI.

The we will create several small projects to demonstrate varied combination of different language and data access technologies.

* [Java + Micronaut Data JPA](./gs-rest.md)
* [Kotlin + Micronaut Data Jdbc](./jdbc-kotlin.md)
* [Kotlin Coroutine + Micronaut Data R2dbc](./r2dbc-kotlin-co.md)
* [Java + Micronaut Mongo Reactive](./mongo-reactive.md)
