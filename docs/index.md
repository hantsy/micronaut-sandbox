# Preface

For Java developers, Micronaut is a relatedly new framework. It provides more concise APIs to building modern cloud-native applications. 

I have used Spring Boot in numerous real-world projects. In my opinion, there is no press when switching to Micronaut. When exploring the Micronaut features in this tutorial, I am trying to introduce them from the view of a Spring Boot developer.

## Audience

I assume you are already a Java developer and know some knowledge of Spring framework and at least used one of the popular Dependency injection frameworks, eg. Spring, Guice, or Weld, or know well about the JSR 330 specification(aka Dependency Inject specification).

I am trying to use the latest Java 17 language syntax in the sample codes. Please update yourself if you are using a lower-versioned Java.


## Sample Codes

All sample codes of this tutorial are available on Github. Get a copy of the source codes, and explore them yourself.

In short, you can clone the project from Github via GIT command line.

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/hantsy/micronaut-sandbox
```
